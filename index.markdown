# About

<p style="color: black;">
    I am an AI/ML Engineer with a diverse background in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Working at the intersection of research, development, and engineering, I specialize in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications, while also being passionate about Deep Learning and AI in general.

In 2024, I joined the **ThereSIS Lab (Secure Information Systems)** at [Thal√®s SIX GTS France](https://www.thalesgroup.com) in Paris as a Research Engineer Intern. There, I conducted state-of-the-art reviews of workflows augmented by LLMs, designed and experimented with multi-agent frameworks for integrating Standard Operating Procedures into mission-critical systems, and authored explanatory articles and papers on Generative AI (GenAI) concepts as part of a science popularization effort.

Previously, in 2023, I interned at [Banque Lombard Odier](https://www.lombardodier.com) in Geneva as an AI Specialist. During my time there, I designed a GenAI solution for translating investment memos, developed and industrialized an API for the service, and participated in foundational discussions on AI governance frameworks.

I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and challenge myself, aiming to apply my expertise in AI and advance scientific understanding. I am particularly interested in innovative environments that bridge the gap between research and engineering.
