I am an AI/ML Engineer with a diverse background in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, acquired through my double degree in *Executive Engineering [^1]* and *AI/ML Research Engineering [^2]*, and through my research engineering internships at *Lombard Odier [^3]* and *THALES [^4]*.

Working at the intersection of research, development, and engineering, I specialize in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications, while also being passionate about Deep Learning and AI in general.

I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and challenge myself, aiming to apply my expertise in AI and advance scientific understanding. I am particularly interested in innovative environments that bridge the gap between research and engineering.

    > In 2024, I joined the *ThereSIS Lab (Secure Information Systems)* at *Thalès SIX GTS France* in Paris as a Research Engineer Intern. There, I conducted state-of-the-art reviews of workflows augmented by LLMs, designed and experimented with multi-agent frameworks for integrating Standard Operating Procedures into mission-critical systems, and authored explanatory articles and papers on Generative AI (GenAI) concepts as part of a science popularization effort.
